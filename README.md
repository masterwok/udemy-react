## React Complete Guide (Udemy)

This repository contains the overarching course project of the Udemy course on ReactJS and Redux.
This is a personal project and has no affiliation with the actual course on Udemy. The primary goal
of this project is to be organized in such a way that it can be referenced by topic/section.

This repository is structured to have each course section within its own branch. Once a section is 
complete, then it will be merged back down into master. Because sections 1-3 focus on
bootstraping the application, they will not have their own branch.
