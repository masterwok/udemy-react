## React Complete Guide (Udemy)

This repository contains the projects built during, [React the Complete Guide Including Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux) course available on Udemy.
**This is a personal project created while following along with the course and is not affiliated with the actual course in any way**. The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a future reference when building applications with ReactJS and Redux.

This repository is structured to have each course section within its own branch. Once a section is 
complete, then it will be merged back down into master. Because sections 1-3 focus on
bootstraping the application, they will not have their own branch.
